# Online-Courses-in-SQLite

I've written queries in sqlite to inspect the following questions:
  
  -- Displaying first view rows 
  -- Totol entries
  -- AVG, MAX and MIN of rating column
  -- # of courses in each category
  -- Top rated courses in for each category
  -- Most profitable courses
  -- Ratings of different platforms
  -- Most popular categories among students
  -- Instructors Distribution to courses 
  -- Which categories had the most topics

The database i used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/elanderos/internet-courses-sqlite/data
